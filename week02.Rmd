# Jan 18: Common geoms and plot styles to know

## Prepare

* `r emo::ji("computer")`: Get to know a `geom`
  * Search Twitter again for more `#TidyTuesday` Week 2 (bees) entries
  * Find examples of at least 3 different geoms used in `#TidyTuesday` charts and write down the names of these geoms
  * Go to the {`ggplot2`} [reference documents](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-geoms) and find your selected geoms
  * For each geom you selected, run a few of the examples and see what happens when you modify the arguments
* `r emo::ji("computer")`: [Interactive {`ggplot2`} tutorial](https://learn.themethodsection.com/tutorials/ggplot2/basics/) from Ariel Muldoon (you'll run the code in the browser)
