## What are their names?

Return a vector of names

## Which prognosticator's city coordinates are closest to a GHCND weather station?

Punxsutawney Phil or Jimmy the Groundhog?

## Create a plot of prediction accuracy over time by `prognosticator_status`

* exclude human mascots
* limit to years with at least 5 per year per level of `prognosticator_status` (except human mascots)
* create a dataset with only `prognosticator_name`, `year`, `predict_early_spring`, `prognosticator_city`, `prognosticator_status`, and `class`
* facet plot by `prognosticator_status`
