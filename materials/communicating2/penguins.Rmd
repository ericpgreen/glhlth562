# Penguins

Did you know that penguins come in different shapes and sizes?

```{r}
  library(palmerpenguins)
  library(tidyverse)
```

Figure @ref(fig:flips) is really nice when you think about it.

```{r, fig.cap="Gentoo penguins have big flippers"}
  ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(color = species), width = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_jitter(aes(color = species), alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE, 
                position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 0)) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(x = "Species",
         y = "Flipper length (mm)")
```
