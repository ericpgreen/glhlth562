## `r emo::ji("open_book")` [SOCVIZ CH 1](https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#lookatdata): Look at data

* Numerical summaries of data are useful but not a substitute for visualizing (remember Anscombeâ€™s quartet)
* Maximize the "data-to-ink" ratio as a general rule, but always spill enough ink to help the viewer
* You have to understand how the data were generated and what they mean before you can plot
* Use default color palettes until you learn how to choose colors wisely
* Think carefully about encoding meaning by different channels at once (color, shape, etc)
* We're not good at comparing angles and area
* It's easy to mislead and be misled

## `r emo::ji("open_book")` [SOCVIZ CH 2](https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html#gettingstarted): Getting started

* Strive to make your plots 100% reproducible
* Creating RMarkdown (Rmd) files in RStudio has distinct advantages over plain R scripts
* Use projects to never need to `setwd()`
* Everything is an object, and the details matter; run `class(myobject)` to check its type and `str(myobject)` to check its contents
* `functions()` do stuff; learn what they do by typing `?function_name in the Console
* Packages are collections of `functions()` 
* The {`readr`} package in the `tidyverse` has useful functions for reading data into R; {`haven`} is great for reading in files from SAS, SPSS, and STATA specifically
* Go easy on yourself and re-read this chapter from time to time

## Class session

* Workspace setup
* Learning to look at a plot and imagine the underlying data structure
* A big barrier for new coders is getting the data into the right format for analysis and visualization (hint: think tidy)
* Learning to look at a plot and identify the elements (the grammar of graphics)
* Introduction to `#TidyTuesday`

## `r emo::ji("tv")` [Reporting on and visualising the pandemic](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/reporting-on-and-visualising-the-pandemic/)

* Text and annotation are your secret weapons
* It's on you if people don't understand your chart
* Consider the emotional and political context when you create charts
* Continued communication is key
* Ease of understanding is first priority
* Consider using animation to tell a story

## `r emo::ji("open_book")` [R4DS CH 3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html): Data visualisation

* Introduction to the `ggplot()` function: `ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))`
* Aesthetic mappings, `aes()`: 
  * aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot (e.g., size, shape, color)
  * mapping means to link your dataset to your plot
* Add layers to your plot with `+`
* geoms are geometrical objects that represents your data (e.g., lines, points)

## `r emo::ji("open_book")` [SOCVIZ CH 5](https://socviz.co/workgeoms.html#workgeoms): Graph tables, add labels, make notes

* First introduction to the pipe operator `%>%`
* Sneak preview of {`dplyr`} functions to clean data
* Sneak preview of facets
* Example of `coord_flip()` to flip x and y axis orientation
* Introducing `scale_` functions, `guides()`, and `theme()`

## Class session

* Reproduced a plot from the *Financial Times* (clean data) to illustrate how to build layer by layer
* Started by `aes()` mapping variables to the x and y axis and indicating grouping by color and added `geom_line()` to plot lines
* Used `scale_color_manual()` to specify group colors
* Used `scale_y_continuous()` and `scale_x_date()` to adjust the x and y axis scales, respectively
* Added a vertical line with `geom_vline()` and shorter line segments with `geom_segment()`
* Annotated the lines with `annotate()`
* Added `title`, `subtitle` and `caption` to `labs()`
* Styled the plot with `theme_minimal()` and `theme()`
