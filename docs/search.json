That is your final project in a\nnutshell.\nOverview\nThe final project for this class will consist of analysis on a\ndataset of your choosing. You can choose the data based on your\ninterests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The\ngoal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the\ntechniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and\napply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.\nThe goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis i.e., do not\ncalculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every\nvariable, but rather let me know that you are proficient at asking\nmeaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis,\nthat you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at\ninterpreting and presenting the results. Focus on methods that help you\nbegin to answer your research questions. You do not have to apply every\nprocedure we learned (and you can use techniques we haven’t officially\ncovered in class, if you’re feeling adventurous). Also, critique your\nown methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. Issues\npertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and\nappropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed\nhere.\nThe project is very open ended. You should create some kind of\ncompelling visualizations of this data in R with an accompanying\nwrite-up. There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use, but\nyou are required to work primarily in the tidyverse (vs base R).\nYou do not need to visualize all of the data at once. A single high\nquality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large\nnumber of poor quality visualizations. Also pay attention to your\npresentation. Neatness, coherency, and clarity will count. All analyses\nmust be done in RStudio, using R.\nYou may work alone or in teams of 2 or 3. We prefer that you work in\nteams.\nData\nTo have the greatest chance of success with this project you should\nselect a manageable dataset. This means that the data should be readily\naccessible and large enough that multiple relationships can be explored.\nAs such, your dataset must have at least 50 observations, ideally many\nmore. Exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first. The\ndataset’s variables should include categorical variables, discrete\nnumerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.\nIf you are using a dataset that comes in a format that we haven’t\nencountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into R as\nthis can be tricky depending on the source. If you are having trouble\nask for help before it is too late.\nDo not reuse datasets used in class.\nBelow are a list of data repositories that might be of interest to\nbrowse. You’re not limited to these resources, and in fact you’re\nencouraged to venture beyond them. But you might find something\ninteresting there:\nTidyTuesday\nNHS Scotland Open\nData\nEdinburgh Open\nData\nOpen access to Scotland’s\nofficial statistics\nBikeshare data\nportal\nUK Gov Data\nKaggle datasets\nOpenIntro\ndatasets\nAwesome\npublic datasets\nYouth\nRisk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)\nPRISM\nData Archive Project\nHarvard Dataverse\nIf you know of others, let me know, and we’ll add here…\nIf the data are not publicly available, you must have the owner’s\npermission to use the data for this assignment. If your dataset includes\nprotected health information or if you are otherwise unable to share it\nwith us, you must use the synthpop\npackage to create a synthetic dataset.\nDeliverables\nProposal - due February 28\nPresentation - due April 6\nProject files and write-up - due April 12\nProposal\nThis is a draft of the introduction section of your project as well\nas a data analysis plan and your dataset.\nSection 1 - Introduction: The introduction\nshould introduce your general research question and your data (where it\ncame from, how it was collected, what are the cases, what are the\nvariables, etc.).\nSection 2 - Data: Place your data in the `/data`\nfolder and use the dataReporter package to create a\ncodebook. Do not include unnecessary columns in your dataset.\nSection 3 - Data analysis plan:\nDescribe the key variables to answer your question\nVery preliminary exploratory data analysis, including some\nsummary statistics and visualizations, along with some explanation on\nhow they help you learn more about your data. (You can add to these\nlater as you work on your project.)\nThe method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your\nquestion(s). (You can update these later as you work on your\nproject.)\nWhat results from these specific statistical methods are needed\nto support your hypothesized answer?\n\nThe grading scheme for the project proposal is as follows. Note that\nafter you receive feedback for your proposal you can improve it based on\nthe feedback and re-submit it. If you re-submit, your final score for\nthe proposal will be the average of two scores you receive (first and\nsecond submission).\nTotal\n10 pts\nData\n3 pts\nProposal\n5 pts\nWorkflow, organization, code quality\n1 pt\nTeamwork\n1 pt\nPresentation\n5 minutes maximum, and each team member should say something\nsubstantial. You can either present live during your slot or pre-record\nand submit your video to be played during the workshop.\nPrepare a slide deck using xaringan. There isn’t a limit\nto how many slides you can use, just a time limit (5 minutes total). If\nyou work with a partner, each person should have a chance to speak\nduring the presentation. Your presentation should not just be an account\nof everything you tried (“then we did this, then we did this, etc.”),\ninstead it should convey what choices you made, and why, and what you\nfound.\nBefore you finalize your presentation, make sure your chunks are\nturned off with echo = FALSE.\nPresentations will take place during the last two sessions of the\nsemester. You will watch presentations from other teams in your workshop\nand provide feedback in the form of peer evaluations. The presentation\nline-up will be generated randomly and posted on April 5.\nThe grading scheme for the presentation is as follows:\nTotal\n50 pts\nTime management: Did the team divide the time well amongst\nthemselves or got cut off going over time?\n4 pts\nContent: Is the research question well designed and is the data\nbeing used relevant to the research question?\n5 pts\nProfessionalism: How well did the team present? Does the\npresentation appear to be well practiced? Did everyone get a chance to\nsay something meaningful about the project?\n5 pts\nTeamwork: Did the team present a unified story, or did it seem like\nindependent pieces of work patched together?\n6 pts\nContent: Did the team use appropriate statistical procedures and\ninterpretations of results accurately?\n10 pts\nCreativity and Critical Thought: Is the project carefully thought\nout? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time\nand effort went into the planning and implementation of the\nproject?\n10 pts\nSlides: Are the slides well organized, readable, not full of text,\nfeaturing figures with legible labels, legends, etc.?\n10 pts\nExecutive summary\nAlong with your presentation slides, we want you to provide a summary\nof your project in the README of your directory/repository. This\nexecutive summary should provide information on the dataset you’re\nusing, your research question(s), your methodology, and your findings.\nThe executive summary is worth 15 points and will be evaluated based on\nwhether it follows guidance and whether it’s concise but detailed\nenough.\nProject Directory Structure\nYou may prepare a zip file of your project files or give us access to\nyour Github repository (if you use one):\nfinal.Rproj\nREADME.Rmd + README.md: Your executive\nsummary (github\nflavored markdown)\n/data: Your dataset in CSV or RDS format and your data\ndictionary\n/deck: Your slide deck (Rmd + html)\n/proposal: Your project proposal (Rmd + html)\nStyle and format does count for this assignment, so please take the\ntime to make sure everything looks good and your data and code are\nproperly formatted. Your files must run without error. Remember, any\nlocal images you use must be included in your directory.\nTips\nReview the marking guidelines below and ask questions if any of\nthe expectations are unclear.\nMake sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of\nquality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from\ndifferent team members).\nSet aside time to work together and apart (physically).\nWhen you’re done, review your documents to make sure you’re happy\nwith the final state of your work.\nCode: In your presentation your code should be hidden\n(echo = FALSE) so that your document is neat and easy to\nread. However your document should include all your code such that if I\nre-knit your R Markdown file I should be able to obtain the results you\npresented.\nException: If you want to highlight something specific about a piece\nof code, you’re welcomed to show that portion.\n\nTeamwork: You are to complete the assignment as a team. All team\nmembers are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this\nassignment and team evaluations will be given at its completion - anyone\njudged to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have\ntheir grade penalized. While different teams members may have different\nbackgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member\nto understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment\nworks.\nMarking\nTotal\n100 pts\nProposal\n10 pts\nPresentation\n50 pts\nExecutive summary\n15 pts\nReproducibility and organization\n10 pts\nTeam peer evaluation\n10 pts\nClassmates’ evaluation\n5 pts\nCriteria\nYour project will be assessed on the following criteria:\nContent - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and\nrelevancy of data to those questions?\nCorrectness - Are procedures carried out and explained\ncorrectly?\nWriting and Presentation - What is the quality of the presentation,\nwriting, and explanations?\nCreativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought\nout? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time\nand effort went into the planning and implementation of the\nproject?\nA general breakdown of scoring is as follows:\n90%-100% - Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all\nstatistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can\nidentify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the\nresults to others.\n80%-89% - Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts,\nputs together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their\nargument, and communicates most results clearly to others.\n70%-79% - Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts\nin several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent\nargument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n60%-69% - Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has\nmisunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent\nargument. Communication of results is unclear.\nBelow 60% - Student is not making a sufficient effort.\nTeam peer evaluation\nYou will be asked to fill out a survey where you rate the\ncontribution and teamwork of each team member out of 10 points. You will\nadditionally report a contribution percentage for each team member.\nFilling out the survey is a prerequisite for getting credit on the team\nmember evaluation. If you are suggesting that an individual did less\nthan 20% of the work, please provide some explanation. If any individual\ngets an average peer score indicating that they did less than 10% of the\nwork, this person will receive half the grade of the rest of the\ngroup.\nLate work policy\nThere is no late submission / make up for the presentation. You must\nbe in class on the day of the presentation to get credit for it\nor pre-record and submit your presentation by 9am in the\nmorning of the presentations.\nThe late work policy for the write-up is 5% of the maximum\nobtainable mark per calendar day up to seven calendar days after the\ndeadline. If you intend to submit work late for the project, you must\nnotify us before the original deadline as well as as soon as the\ncompleted work is submitted.\nFinal project template modified from Data Science in a\nBox\n\n\n\n",

You’ll learn how\nto break down a plot into its component parts, imagine the underlying\ndata structure, and create effective visuals.\nNext, we’ll dig into the core data wrangling skills required in every\ndata science project. You’ll learn about data transformation, import,\ntidying, joining, strings, factors, dates, and iteraton—oh my.\nBy this point of the course you will have enough of a foundation in R\nto learn about modeling, and I’ll introduce you to the tidy models\nframework. As we talk about machine learning, we’ll also spend time\nthinking about data science ethics and algorithmic bias.\nFollowing modeling, we’ll zoom out and discuss the importance of\nhaving reproducible workflows. I’ll introduce you to literate\nprogramming and the world of RMarkdown. We’ll spend time learning about\nhow to create two specific outputs: dashboards and slide decks.\nWe’ll finish the course with some topics of my choosing. Maybe we’ll\nexplore maps and text mining. Or maybe we’ll take a beat and revisit\ntopics that tripped us up along the way.

All you need to participate is a computer with an internet\nconnection. Our tech stack will include:\nR\nRStudio\nDesktop\nZoom for remote learning (if the situation arises) and office\nhours\nEd for course discussion\nFormat\nYou’ll prepare for each class session by reading and practicing.\nDuring class, we’ll divide our time discussing concepts and running\ncode. I’ll often suggest opportunities for you to continue practicing\nafter class.\nWeekly Assignments\nEach week you will explore a new Tidy\nTuesday dataset. The R4DS Online Learning Community posts a new\ndataset each Monday. We’ll leave time in our Tuesday sessions to review\nthe dataset, and then you will have until Sunday to explore it. I’ll\nprovide you with a template for reporting. In the beginning of the\ncourse when your skills are more limited, I’ll ask you to think more\nabout the data and what you want to do. As the semester goes on, I’ll\nexpect that your explorations become more sophisticated. In addition to\nexploring the datasets on your own, I’ll also ask you to find a\n#tidytuesday entry on Twitter, examine the author’s code\nand describe what you learned from them.\nMid-semester skills/comprehension check-in (replaces 2 weeks of\nTidyTuesday)\nFinal Project\nYou will also complete a final project alone or with partners using a\ndataset of your choosing. Details forthcoming.\nExams\nThere are no exams (including no final exam).\nGrading\nYou will be evaluated on the basis of your weekly assignments (50%)\nand independent project (50%). Ranges for letter grades will be set at\nthe end of the semester. Cumulative scores of at least 90, 80, and 70\nwill be guaranteed at least an A-, B-, and C-, respectively.\nPolicies\nIf you miss an assignment deadline (Sundays at 10pm Eastern), get in\ntouch so we can discuss if a make-up or extension is possible. Missing\nmore than one deadline could result in grade penalties. Class sessions\nwill be recorded.\nStudents should abide by the Duke\nCommunity Standard at all times. If a questionable circumstance\narises, do not hesitate to seek my guidance (before is always better\nthan after).\nEquity and Inclusion at DGHI\nIn 2020 DGHI formed the Equity Task Force to identify and address\nstructural inequities related to global power dynamics, race, ethnicity,\ngender, and all marginalized identities throughout the institute. See here for more information on this work.\nIf you require any accommodations or arrangements (hearing, vision,\nEnglish language comprehension, extenuating personal or family\ncircumstances, etc.) please let me know ASAP and, if relevant, please\ncontact the Student Disability Access Office (SDOA) to ensure the\naccommodation/arrangements can be implemented in a timely fashion.\n\n\n\n",
