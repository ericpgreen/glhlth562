Durham Public Schools publishes a COVID-19 "dashboard". Check it out [here](https://www.dpsnc.net/Page/5339). 

Click on any of the links and you will find a PDF. There are tools for extracting data from pdfs, but fortunately you'll find a [link to a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kQ35JKpk3vNaM7ZfFK2DFb1B9kQIQ4IODr7lOM394nQ/edit#gid=769268401). Please open it.

## 1. Describe the data structure. 



## 2. This sheet appears to be updated weekly. What are some barriers to feeding this sheet into a data pipeline that will always plot the latest results?



## 3. Import this sheet into R and assign it to an object called `raw`. (hint: you need to do this in a way that your analysis will update every time you knit this document)

```{r}
  raw <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kQ35JKpk3vNaM7ZfFK2DFb1B9kQIQ4IODr7lOM394nQ/edit#gid=769268401")
```

## 4. What are the steps you need to do to get this into a tidy dataframe?



## 5. Go!

```{r}

```
