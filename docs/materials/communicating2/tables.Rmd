  I can teach you about tables

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

# Check out this new package

Tables are a pain, but `gtsummary` makes it a breeze. Start by installing the package.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  install.packages("gtsummary")
  install.packages("gt")
```

Table \@ref(tab:atable) shows a basic example of a summary table:

```{r atable, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="This is a caption."}
library(gtsummary)
library(gt)

trial %>% 
  select(age, grade, response, trt) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = trt, # split table by group
    missing = "no" # don't list missing data separately
  ) %>%
  add_n() %>% # add column with total number of non-missing observations
  add_p() %>% # test for a difference between groups
  modify_header(label = "**Variable**") %>% # update the column header
  bold_labels() %>%
  modify_caption("**Patient Characteristics** (N = {N})")
```
